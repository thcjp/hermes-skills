# ç»¼åçæ Dlazy Generate

[English](/api/v1/skills/dlazy-generate/file?path=SKILL.md&ownerHandle=dlazyai) · [中文](/api/v1/skills/dlazy-generate/file?path=SKILL-cn.md&ownerHandle=dlazyai)

A comprehensive generation skill. Can generate images, videos, and audio by automatically selecting the appropriate dlazy CLI model.

## Trigger Keywords

* generate
* create image, video, audio
* multimodal generation

## Authentication

All requests require a dLazy API key. The recommended way to authenticate is:

```bash
This runs a device-code flow (also works in remote shells) and **automatically saves your API key** to the local CLI config — no manual copy/paste required.

### Alternative: Set the Key Manually

If you already have an API key, you can save it directly:

```bash
dlazy auth set YOUR_API_KEY
```

The CLI saves the key in your user config directory (`~/.dlazy/config.json` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.dlazy\config.json` on Windows), with file permissions restricted to your OS user account. You can also supply the key per-invocation via the `DLAZY_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Getting Your API Key Manually

1. Sign in or create an account at [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)
2. Go to [dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key)
3. Copy the key shown in the API Key section

Each key is scoped to your dLazy organization and can be **rotated or revoked at any time** from the same dashboard.

## About & Provenance

* **CLI source code**: [github.com/dlazyai/cli](https://github.com/dlazyai/cli)
* **Maintainer**: dlazyai
* **npm package**: `@dlazy/cli` (pinned to `1.0.9` in this skill's install spec)
* **Homepage**: [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)

You can install on demand without persisting a global binary by running:

```bash
npx @dlazy/cli@1.2.0 <command>
```

Or, if you prefer a global install, the skill's `metadata.clawdbot.install` field declares the exact pinned version (`npm install -g @dlazy/cli@1.2.0`). Review the GitHub source before installing.

## How It Works

This skill is a thin client over the dLazy hosted API. When you invoke it:

* Prompts and parameters you provide are sent to the dLazy API endpoint (`api.dlazy.com`) for inference.
* Any local file paths you pass to image / video / audio fields are uploaded to dLazy's media storage (`files.dlazy.com`) so the model can read them — the same flow as any cloud-based generation API.
* Generated output URLs returned by the API are hosted on `files.dlazy.com`.

This is the standard SaaS pattern; the skill itself does not access network or filesystem resources beyond what the dLazy CLI already handles. See [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com) for the full service terms.

## Piping Between Commands

Every `dlazy` invocation prints a JSON envelope on stdout. Any flag value can be a **pipe reference** that pulls from the upstream command's envelope, so you can chain steps without copying URLs by hand.

| Reference | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `-` | Upstream's natural value for this field (scalar or array) |
| `@N` | The N-th output's primary value (e.g. `@0` = first output url) |
| `@N.<jsonpath>` | Drill into the N-th output (`@0.url`, `@1.meta.fps`) |
| `@*` | All outputs' primary values as an array |
| `@stdin` | The whole upstream JSON envelope |
| `@stdin:<jsonpath>` | Jsonpath into the whole envelope (`@stdin:result.outputs[0].url`) |

### Examples

```bash
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "a red fox in snow" \
  | dlazy kling-v3 --image - --prompt "fox starts running"

dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "lighthouse at dawn" \
  | dlazy keling-tts --text "Welcome to the coast." --image @0.url

dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "city skyline" --n 4 \
  | dlazy superres --images @*
```

> Required flags can be entirely sourced from the pipe — `--field -` satisfies the requirement when an upstream value exists. If stdin is empty, the CLI fails with `code: "no_stdin"`.

## Usage

This is a comprehensive skill that routes generation requests to the appropriate `dlazy` model based on the user's intent.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENT**:

1. Determine the media type (image, video, or audio) requested by the user.
2. Select the most appropriate model from the list above.
3. Run `dlazy <model_name> -h` to check the required parameters for that specific model.
4. Execute the command (e.g., `dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "..."`).

## Error Handling

| Code | Error Type | Example Message |

| 501 | Missing required parameter | `error: required option '--prompt <prompt>' not specified` |
| 502 | Local file read error | `Error: Image file/Video file not found: C:\path\to\your\file` |
| 503 | API request failed (no balance) | `ok: false, code: "insufficient_balance"` |

> **AGENT CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**:
>
> 1. If the execution result returns `code: "insufficient_balance"`, you MUST explicitly inform the user that their credits are insufficient and guide them to recharge: <https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/settings?tab=credits>
> 2. If the execution result returns `code: "unauthorized"` or indicates missing API key, you MUST inform the user to get their API key from <https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key> and save it using `dlazy auth set <key>` and resume the task.
