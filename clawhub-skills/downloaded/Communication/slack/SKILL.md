# Slack

## Overview

The `slack` skill provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to control Slack from Clawdbot, including message reactions, message management, pinning/unpinning messages, and retrieving member information. This skill is ideal for automating workflows and enhancing team communication.

## Inputs to Collect

To use the `slack` skill, you need to provide the following inputs:

- `channelId`: The ID of the Slack channel where the action should be performed.
- `messageId`: The ID of the Slack message to be targeted (e.g., a message timestamp).
- `emoji`: An emoji to react to a message (in Unicode format or using Slack emoji names).
- `to`: The target for sending messages, specified as `channel:<id>` or `user:<id>`.
- `content`: The content of the message to be sent, edited, or deleted.
- `userId`: The ID of the Slack user whose information you want to retrieve.

## Actions

### Action Groups

The `slack` skill offers the following action groups:

- `reactions`: Manage reactions to messages.
- `messages`: Read, send, edit, and delete messages.
- `pins`: Pin and unpin messages.
- `memberInfo`: Retrieve information about Slack members.
- `emojiList`: List custom emoji in Slack.

### React to a Message

To react to a message, provide the `channelId`, `messageId`, and `emoji`. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "action": "react",
  "channelId": "C123",
  "messageId": "1712023032.1234",
  "emoji": "✅"
}
```

### Send a Message

To send a message, specify the `to` target and `content`. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "action": "sendMessage",
  "to": "channel:C123",
  "content": "Hello from Clawdbot"
}
```

### Pin a Message

To pin a message, provide the `channelId` and `messageId`. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "action": "pinMessage",
  "channelId": "C123",
  "messageId": "1712023032.1234"
}
```

### List Pinned Items

To list pinned items in a channel, provide the `channelId`. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "action": "listPins",
  "channelId": "C123"
}
```

### Retrieve Member Information

To retrieve information about a Slack member, provide the `userId`. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "action": "memberInfo",
  "userId": "U123"
}
```

### List Custom Emoji

To list custom emoji in Slack, use the `emojiList` action. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "action": "emojiList"
}
```

- Use the `react` action to mark completed tasks with a checkmark emoji.
- Pin important decisions or weekly status updates for easy reference.
