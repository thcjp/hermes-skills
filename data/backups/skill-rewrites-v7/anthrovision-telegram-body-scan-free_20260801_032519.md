## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Reason | Handling Method |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| height_cm out of range | Input value less than 100 or greater than 250 | Prompt the user to provide a height range of 100-250cm and request re-entry |
| Invalid gender value | Input is not male/female | Prompt that only male or female are supported and request re-entry |
| Local file path submission | User provides `/Users/...`, `file://...` paths | Reject local paths and request upload of an attachment or provision of a `https://` URL |
| Private URL submission | URL is localhost, 127.0.0.1, RFC1918 network segment | Reject private URLs and request provision of a public `https://` URL |
| scan_id not found | The scan_id does not exist in check_scan | Confirm that the scan_id matches the one submitted and, if expired, resubmit |

## Common Questions

### Q1: What inputs are required?
A: Required inputs include `gender` (male/female), `height_cm` (100-250), `video` attachment or downloadable `https://` URL, and `phone_model` (e.g., iPhone 13). Local file paths and private network segment URLs are not accepted.

### Q2: How long does the processing take?
A: Generally, processing takes 48-90 seconds. Poll the status during processing, and output measurement data after the status is complete. For timeout handling (delayed messages and inquiries) exceeding 3 minutes, upgrade to the paid version.

### Q3: Does the output include waist-to-hip ratio?
A: The free version only outputs basic measurement data (chest, waist, hip circumference) and does not provide waist-to-hip ratio summary or deterministic response formatting. For waist-to-hip ratio and deterministic response formatting output, please upgrade to the paid version.

### Q4: What if the phone model is not calibrated?
A: The free version does not provide phone model calibration prompts. Measurement accuracy may be reduced and no prompts are provided for uncalibrated models. For calibration prompts and model recommendations, please upgrade to the paid version.

## Error Handling (Continued)

| Error Scenario (Continued) | Reason | Handling Method |
|:---------|---------:|:---------|
| LLM response timeout or no response | Network latency or high model load | Check network connection and configuration, then retry; confirm that the LLM service of the Agent platform is normal |
| Input content format incorrect | User input does not match skill expected format | Check whether the input matches the format requirements in the skill usage instructions and refer to the example section |
| Execution result does not match expectations | Instruction description is not clear or lacks context | Provide more detailed instruction descriptions and supplement necessary context information |
| Command execution fails | Runtime environment does not meet requirements or insufficient permissions | Confirm that the runtime environment meets the requirements specified in the dependency section; check command permission settings |
